# Contributing to SysCaller

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **SysCaller**!

SysCaller has evolved significantly through v1.0.0, v1.1.0, and v1.2.0. The project is now in a more mature state with a complete C++ Qt based GUI (Bind), comprehensive multi language bindings, and a stable core architecture.

---

## What You *Can* Contribute Right Now

I welcome PRs and improvements for the following:

### Core SysCaller SDK
- **Syscall Constants & Definitions**  
  Add new constants or improve existing ones in the constants headers (`SysCaller/Wrapper/include/Sys/sysConstants.h`, `SysCallerK/Wrapper/include/SysK/sysConstants_k.h`) or other definitions in related header files.

- **New Syscalls**  
  Add support for additional Windows syscalls that aren't currently implemented.

- **Kernel Mode Enhancements**  
  Improve the SysCallerK kernel mode library functionality and compatibility.
  
### Bind (GUI) Contributions
With v1.2.0, the GUI has been completely rewritten in C++ Qt and is now much more stable. I'm now accepting:

- **Bug Fixes** for the Bind GUI

- **Performance Optimizations**

- **Minor UI/UX Improvements** (layout tweaks, accessibility improvements)

- **New Features** that align with the existing design patterns

### Examples & Bindings
- **Examples**  
  Add usage examples (in `Bindings/Examples/`) for different use cases:
  - Kernel Mode use
  - Driver safe syscall usage
  - Any use case that demonstrates SysCaller's capabilities

- **Language Bindings**  
  Create binding examples for additional programming languages beyond the current C, C++, C#, Rust, Python, Go, and Nim support.
  > Tip: Any language with C bindings is SysCaller compatible!

### Documentation & Guides
- **Documentation**  
  Improvements to `README.md` or the `Wiki`, inline comments, or new markdown files (such as guides, tutorials, or technical explanations).

- **Translations**  
  If you want to contribute translations for SysCaller outside of English, I'm all for it.

### Build System & Infrastructure
- **CMake Improvements**  
  Enhance the CMake build system, especially for kernel mode and GUI builds.

## What I'm *Not* Accepting (Yet)

### Major GUI Redesigns
While Bind is now stable, major architectural changes to the GUI are not currently needed. The current Qt based design serves the project well.

### Experimental Features
Features that would significantly change the core API or break existing functionality are not currently being accepted.

### Multi-Architectual Support
I plan on only supporting x64 for the time being, maybe x86 can get support in a way where it wont clutter the project. (ARM is also not planned.)

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow the existing code style in the respective directories
- Add appropriate comments for complex logic
- Ensure all code builds cleanly on Windows 10/11 x64

### Pull Request Process
1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch
2. Make your changes with clear and focused commits
3. Test your changes thoroughly
4. Update documentation if needed
5. Submit a PR with:
   - A clear title
   - A concise description of what was changed and why

### Testing Requirements
- Ensure your changes work with both user mode (SysCaller) and kernel mode (SysCallerK) where applicable
- Test with the Bind GUI if your changes affect the build process
- Verify that existing examples still work correctly

## Getting Started

> Note: SysCaller targets Windows 10/11 x64. Other platforms/architectures (like ARM or Linux) wont be supported.

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/micREsoft/SysCaller.git
   cd SysCaller
   ```

2. **Set up your development environment:**
Building Bind:
   - Install Visual Studio 2019+ with MSVC v142 toolset
   - Install Qt 5.12 for Bind development
   - Install vcpkg and required dependencies (`cmark`, `pe-parse`)
   - requires **C++ 20**

Building SysCaller/SysCallerK:
   - Install Visual Studio 2022
   - Install Windows SDK for SysCaller
   - Install Windows WDK for SysCallerK
   - requires **C++ 17 or later**

3. **Build the project:**
   - Open `SysCaller.sln` for core libraries
   - Open `Bind/Bind.sln` for the GUI

4. **Choose an area to contribute** from the sections above
